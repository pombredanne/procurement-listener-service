# The Procurement Listener Service #


The Procurement Listener Service is a reference implementation of the 
Procurement Listener API, which is used to listen to procurement related
events coming from an online store that sells Cloud-enabled software. 
Service providers can implement the API, similar to the implementation
here to participate in the procurement flow of the upstream store.

<p>This project also contains a basic conformance suite for testing the
compliance of implementatinos.
